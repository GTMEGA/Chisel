All textures shipped in blocks/ZC/... are based on Ztones blocks, but need new textures to be legally distributable.
These new textures are in grayscale. The colored versions are in a specific resource pack, to remain copyright protected.
I know this might seem sort of shady or lazy, but I'm not gonna make two sets of different resolution textures when I can
just make one, and have rights for it. -Houston. Sorry in advance for this annoyance.

If you have a resource pack with ztones textures, you can relocate those files into the appropriate chisel folders, and get most of the way there.
You can also edit a lang file in the pack to reflect the textures on the blocks.
